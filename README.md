# Data-Science-Notes
# README: My Learnings from the Data Sciences Lab (WorldQuant University)

## Introduction
This document summarizes my key takeaways and personal growth from the Data Sciences Lab program at WorldQuant University. It highlights the core skills, tools, and mindsets I developed.

## Technical Skills Acquired

- **Data Manipulation:**
  - Efficient use of pandas for data cleaning, transformation, and exploratory analysis.
  - Handling missing values, data types, outliers, and encoding categorical features.

- **Visualization:**
  - Built clear, insightful visuals using matplotlib, seaborn, and plotlyexpress for both exploration and communication.

- **Machine Learning Workflow:**
  - Structured approach: data splitting, establishing baselines, modeling, evaluation, and result communication.
  - End-to-end training using sklearn’s models and metrics; mastered iterative improvement cycles.

- **Time Series Analysis:**
  - Applied AR, ARIMA, and advanced metrics (ACF/PACF, walk-forward validation) to real datasets.

- **Database Integration:**
  - Managed data with SQL (sqlite3) and MongoDB; automated data ingestion and query from Jupyter.

- **Model Deployment & Pipelines:**
  - Built deployable models and interactive dashboards. Streamlined processes with sklearn pipelines.

- **Advanced Topics:**
  - Hyperparameter tuning (grid search, cross-validation)
  - Regularization to handle overfitting and high-dimensional spaces.
  - Decision Trees, Ensemble Methods (Random Forests, Gradient Boosting), and Clustering (K-Means).

## Conceptual & Analytical Insights

- **Always question the data:** Validate surprising results against domain knowledge; choose the right metric for the question (e.g., mean vs. per-unit comparisons).
- **Baseline before sophistication:** Establish simple benchmarks and improve with iteration.
- **Prepare for imbalanced and messy data:** Proper resampling and imputation are critical.
- **Visualization ≠ Decoration:** Use charts to challenge assumptions and clarify results, not just to illustrate.
- **Communicate for action:** Condense complex findings into actionable insights for stakeholders, not just technical outputs.

## Mindset & Best Practices

- **Be thorough:** No shortcut to understanding – dive deep into new techniques and terms.
- **Be reproducible:** Use consistent seed values and pipelines for reliable results.
- **Stay ethical:** Recognize when models can reinforce biases (be mindful of "Weapons of Math Destruction").
- **Iterate and Reflect:** Every failed model or pipeline is a learning step, not a setback.

## Closing Thoughts

The Data Sciences Lab armed me with both practical tools and the ability to make sound, ethical, and impactful data-driven decisions. More than syntax or algorithms, I learned how to reason with data, test assumptions, and communicate insights clearly—a toolkit for lifelong learning in data science.
